                        Vehicle Upgrades  
                        You are permitted to modify your car, including turbo upgrades and other enhancements. However, it is imperative that these modifications remain realistic. The use of unrealistic colors, extreme camber angles, or excessively lifted vans is strictly prohibited. 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Combat Logging 
                        You are not allowed to leave the game during a session to evade punishment from staff or law enforcement. Such actions will result in consequences, including potential bans from the server or receiving a mark if you are caught. 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        FRP Speed Limit  
                        You are required to drive below the FRP speed limit. Exceeding this limit will result in moderation actions, including receiving a mark. Please ensure you stay within the FRP speed limit to avoid penalties from staff members.  
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        Speed Limit  
                        You must adhere to the posted speed limits indicated by road signs. Compliance with these limits is essential to avoid being pulled over. 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        Voiding  
                        Only Staff Members are permitted to use the term "Void" in situations involving unrealistic roleplay or disruptions. This privilege is exclusive to staff members. Civilians or law enforcement personnel are not allowed to use it, and any violation will result in consequences. When a staff member declares "VOID," you must leave the scene and continue the roleplay elsewhere. 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        Avatar Guidelines  
                        Users are prohibited from using unrealistic avatars that do not serve a purpose for Roleplay. Management Staff members may grant permission for specific users to use unrealistic avatars if they are essential for the roleplay. However, these avatars must be changed after the roleplay session. A maximum of two users, or more with permission from the Ownership Team, are allowed to use such avatars. 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        Exchanging 
                        In the Role-play of an accident, you are required to pull over, exit your vehicle, and properly type out either "exchanges" or "hands insurance." If this not happening and you got proof of the Video you may contact active Law Enforcement or active Staff! 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        Yielding to Emergency Services or Staff 
                        It is mandatory to yield for emergency services or staff. Please immediately pull over to the side to allow them to pass by. 
                        
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        
                        Team Assignment Policy 
                          
                        You are not permitted to join the criminal team unless there is a designated special roleplay or you have been instructed by staff to change teams. The same policy applies to police roles. You must have the required roles to join these teams.
